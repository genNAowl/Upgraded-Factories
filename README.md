### <p align="center">A 6.0 mod that adds tier 2 versions of existing factories</p>

# Content: 
### Furnace
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/furnace.gif)

An advanced kiln. Requires pyratite to craft metaglass. Uses heat tiles as an optional booster. 
### Plastanium Condenser
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/plastanium-condenser.gif)

An advanced plastanium compressor. Uses organics to help condense plastanium. Uses oil tiles as an optional booster. 
### Phase Spinner
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/phase-spinner.gif)

An advanced phase weaver. Uses silicon to help weave phase fabric. 
### Alloy Crucible
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/alloy-crucible.gif)

An advanced alloy smelter. Requires both pyratite and cryofluid to forge surge alloy. Uses heat tiles as an optional booster. 
### Pyratite Blender
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/pyratite-blender.gif)

An advanced pyratite mixer. Requires oil to help create pyratite. 
### Blast Blender
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/blast-blender.gif)

An advanced blast mixer. Requires oil to help create blast compound. 
### Cryofluid Blender
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/cryofluid-blender.gif)

An advanced cryofluid mixer. Now requires silicon as well as titanium. Due to the heavy spinners, this factory has a long warmup time. 
### Liquefier
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/liquefier.gif)

An advanced melter. Requires pyratite to generate the heat required to melt tons of scrap. 
### Spore Compactor
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/spore-compactor.gif)

An advanced spore press. Due to the enormous pressure used when crushing organics, coal is formed as a side product. 
### Crusher
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/crusher.gif)

An advanced pulverizer. Requires water as a coolant to help crush scrap. 
### Coal Synthesizer
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/coal-synthesizer.gif)

An advanced coal centrifuge. Replaces the centrifuge with a synthesizer, which requires organics as a base. 
### Water Extorter
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/water-extorter.gif)

An advanced water extractor. Uses more power and space to extract more water. 
### Nurturer
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/nurturer.gif)

An advanced cultivator. Larger, but more efficient than it's predecessor. 
### Oil Extorter
![demo](https://github.com/genNAowl/Upgraded-Factories/blob/master/assets/demos/oil-extorter.gif)

An advanced oil extractor. Uses more power, sand, and space to frack more oil.
